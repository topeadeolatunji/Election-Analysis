# Report on the Colorado Election Audit Results


## Overview of Election Audit

The election audit involves the summary of total votes for 3 candidates (Charles Casper Stockham, Diane DeGette and Raymon Anthony Doane), for votes that were tallied in 3 counties (Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe). The report seeks to answer, using Python, the total votes, candidates' share of the total votes and winning candidates based on percentage and count of votes accumulated. Separately, the report seeks to answer voter turnout in each county and total county votes and which county had the most voter turnout.


### Results
There were 369,711 total votes in the 3 counties specified above. Of the 3 counties, Denver had the greatest voter turnout with 306,055 votes counted, that is about 83% of the total votes. This makes sense given that Denver is a major metropolitan area in Colorado and majority of the voters are concentrated in the city of Denver. Of the 3 candidates, Diane DeGette was the winning candidates with 272,892 votes, that represent about 73.8% of the total votes. 

### Candidates
The 3 candidates in the election were Charles Casper Stockham, Diane DeGette and Raymon Anthony Doane. The split of votes were 85,213 (23%), 272,892 (73.8%), 11,606 (3.1%) in order that the candidates are listed. Diane DeGette carried the most votes and is therefore the winning candidates as per election audited counts.


### Counties
The 3 counties were Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe. The split of votes were 38,855 (10.5%), 306,055 (82.8%) and 24,801 (6.7%) in the order that the counties are listed. Denver had the greatest voter turnout among all 3 counties. Although its out of the scope of this report to accurately determine voter turnout by county as we would require the total population of each county to reasonably determine the voters in relation to total population by counties.


#### Summary

In summary, the report depicts the election audit results and deems Diane DeGette to be the winning candidates and Denver to be the county that contributed the most voters amongst the 3 reporting counties.
